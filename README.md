## What Happened in Iran

A few weeks ago, Iran went through one of the darkest periods in its modern history. During nationwide protests against economic hardship and political repression, **tens of thousands of people were killed in the crackdown** — with some estimates suggesting the death toll **could be over 30,000**. [^1][^2][^3]  
The Iranian regime responded with **extreme brutality**, using live ammunition, detentions, and violence against largely unarmed civilians.

To silence the population and prevent information from reaching the outside world, the authorities **shut down the internet nationwide for weeks**, disconnecting millions from global communication and reporting. [^4][^5][^6]

## What Iranian People Want
The Iranian people are not asking for anything extraordinary. They want a **normal life**, just like people in other countries.  
They want **freedom of expression**, freedom of choice, dignity, safety, and the chance to build their lives without fear of violence or repression.

## How You Can Help

One of the most important things Iranians need is to be **understood and heard**. Share accurate information on social media, keep conversations about these events alive, and support global awareness.  
Access to **free and uncensored internet** is critical — technologies like **Starlink** and other tools that bypass censorship help people stay connected, document what’s happening, and communicate with the world when networks are shut down.

Awareness matters. Visibility matters. Silence only helps oppression.
